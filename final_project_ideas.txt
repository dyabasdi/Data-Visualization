1) Fuel Efficiency Analysis and Prediction

    Dataset: Public datasets like the EPAâ€™s fuel economy dataset or CSV files from telematics systems.
    Machine Learning Task: Train models to predict fuel efficiency based on vehicle parameters like speed, weight, engine type, and terrain.
    Visualization:
    Dynamic scatter plots comparing predicted vs. actual efficiency.
    Heatmaps of geographic regions with high fuel consumption.
    Applications:
    Inform drivers on optimizing routes and driving behavior.
    Assist manufacturers in testing vehicle designs.
